# Pluggy Connect Quickstart

Here you'll find every posible Pluggy Connect integration with different client-side tools

It's really important to understand that each one of the examples needs to fetch a connect token from a previusly setupped API. To do this you can [just deploy this project](https://github.com/pluggyai/pluggy-connect-vercel) in minutes with [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

For most up-to-date and accurate documentation regarding both **Pluggy Connect** and **Connect Token**, please see our [API Reference page](https://docs.pluggy.ai).
